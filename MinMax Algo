1. Mini-max algorithm is a recursive or backtracking algorithm which is used in decision-making and game theory. It provides an optimal move for the player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally.
2. The Min-Max algorithm is mostly used for game playing in AI. Such as Chess, Checkers, tic-tac-toe, go, and various two-players games. This Algorithm computes the minimax decision for the current state.
3. In this algorithm two players play the game; one is called MAX and other is called MIN.
4. Both Players of the game are opponents of each other, where MAX will select the maximized value and MIN will select the minimized value.
5. The minimax algorithm performs a depth-first search algorithm for the exploration of the complete game tree.
