Step 1: SET STATUS = 1 (ready state) for each node in G
Step 2: Push the starting node A on the stack and set its STATUS = 2 (waiting state)
Step 3: Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until STACK is empty
Step 4: Pop the top node N. Process it and set its STATUS = 3 (processed state)
Step 5: Push on the stack all the neighbors of N that are in the ready state (whose STATUS = 1) and set their STATUS = 2 (waiting state)
[END OF LOOP]
Step 6: EXIT
