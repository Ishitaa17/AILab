Make an open list containing starting node
If it reaches the destination node :
Make a closed empty list 
If it does not reach the destination node, then consider a node with the lowest f-score in the open list
We are finished

Else :
Put the current node in the list and check its neighbors

For each neighbor of the current node :
If the neighbor has a lower g value than the current node and is in the closed list:
Replace neighbor with this new node as the neighbor’s parent

Else If (current g is lower and neighbor is in the open list):
Replace neighbor with the lower g value and change the neighbor’s parent to the current node.

Else If the neighbor is not in both lists:
Add it to the open list and set its g
